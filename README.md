This is my first time building a website from scratch. This is part passion project, part brand-building effort. As the company name implies, I am primarily a graphic designer, who has taken a significant interest in web design and development. As a completely self-taught designer/front-end developer, I am thrilled to have gotten to the point where I can build a site like this from the ground up.

You may wonder (as I often have, when browsing designers' websites) **"how much of this site did you *really* build."** I can honestly say, I built it all. You can browse the source code and see that I imported very few frameworks/libraries. Possibly to a fault, I typed nearly every line of the code myself rather than using readily available libraries. Although I understand the value of framworks like bootstrap, etc., for this project I wanted to challenge myself to understand every line that went into the build process.  

I am particularly proud of how the gallery page is coming together. I will admit, the most automated part of the development of this site was the implementation of the favicon, and icons for various devices and platforms. For this process I utilized https://realfavicongenerator.net/, which made the process *much* less painful. 

Enjoy! Suggestions and positive/constructive criticism are welcome.
