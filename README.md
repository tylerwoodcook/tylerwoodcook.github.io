### The Vision
This is my first time building a website from scratch. This is part passion project, part brand-building effort. As the company name implies, I am primarily a graphic designer, who has taken a significant interest in web design and development. As a completely self-taught designer/front-end developer, I am thrilled to have gotten to the point where I can build a site like this from the ground up.

### The Question
You may wonder (as I often have, when browsing designers' websites) **"how much of this site did you *really* build."** I can honestly say, I built it all. You can browse the source code and see that I imported very few frameworks/libraries. Possibly to a fault, I typed nearly every line of the code myself rather than using readily available libraries. Although I understand the value of libraries like bootstrap, etc., for this project I wanted to challenge myself to understand every line that went into the build process.  

### Looking Back
I am particularly proud of how the gallery page is coming together. I will admit, the most automated part of the development of this site was the implementation of the favicon, and icons for various devices and platforms. For this process I utilized https://realfavicongenerator.net/, which made the process *much* less painful. 

### Moving Forward
I hope you will enjoy my site, draw some inspiration, or even reach out to chat. For those who are starting out, I encourage you to never give up on what you love doing, even if you feel like it will never work out (I graduated in 2015 with a Bachelor of Social Work degree; now I work full time as an in-house graphic designer, run a freelance design business on the side, and I'm diving head-first into web development). Suggestions and constructive criticism are welcome!
