# Linepup Design Co.  
Company Website: www.linepup.com  

This is my first time building a website from scratch. This is part passion project, part brand-building effort. As a completely self-taught designer/front-end developer, I am thrilled to have gotten to this point. Enjoy! Suggestions and positive/constructive criticism are welcome.
