This is my first time building a website from scratch. Long hours, and much research has brought me to the place where I can successfully implement a portfolio website. This is part passion project, part brand-building effort. As a completely self-taught designer/front-end developer, I am thrilled to have gotten to this point. Enjoy! Suggestions and positive/constructive criticism are welcome.
